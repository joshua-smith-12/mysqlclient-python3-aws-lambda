# AWS layer for `mysqlclient` for Python 3.x

## TLDR

- Are you using Python 3.8?
- Are you using MySQL v8.0.x?
- Are you having trouble importing/using [mysqlclient](https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python) in your AWS Lambda function?
- Are you in a hurry?

If you answered `yes` to all the above questions, simply upload `layer.zip` from the `build_output` dir as an AWS Layer to your AWS account.

If you answered `no` to any of the above questions, then read on to figure out if you need to build your own `mysqlclient` AWS layer with the tools provided in this repo.

For details on how to upload a zip file as a new layer to AWS Lambda, see the section below called **create a new AWS layer with `layer.zip`**.

After you create the required layer, you can configure your Lambda function to use this layer and simply `import MySQLdb` without error in your Lambda function.

Here's a barebones example to test if you are able to import and use `mysqlclient` correctly:

```python
import MySQLdb

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'MySQLdb was successfully imported'
    }
```

If you get the success message and don't see an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'MySQLdb'` or `ImportError: No module named _mysql`, then you're all set to use `mysqlclient` on AWS Lambda.

## Motivation

`mysqlclient` is usually the first choice for connecting to a MySQL database in Python because of its top-notch performance in most use-cases.

However, since it is a thin wrapper on a C-implementation, it has dependencies on a `libmysqlclient.so` binary, and is thus not a "pure-python" implementation. The binary it depends on, unfortunately, introduces platform-specific dependencies. For example, you can't use `mysqlclient` on AWS Lambda with a binary compiled for another platform such as Mac OS. The `libmysqlclient.so` for AWS Lambda needs to be compatible with the specific `Amazon Linux 2` environment that AWS Lambda runs in, and this can be tedious to get right.

Therefore, it is non-trivial to use `mysqlclient` in AWS Lambda Python code, especially when you want to deploy it in an [AWS Lambda Layer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html).

### goal

The goal of this project is to provide an easy way to build an AWS Lambda layer for `mysqlclient` so that this package can be readily used in an AWS Lambda Python function. By including the layer in your Lambda function configuration, you can just `import MySQLdb` as usual and get on with your actual code.

### mysqlclient

[mysqlclient](https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python) is a mature, stable driver for MySQL, actively maintained by members of the PyMySQL community, and [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/). It provides a Python wrapper around the MySQL C API; the [core is implemented in C](https://mysqlclient.readthedocs.io/user_guide.html).

`mysqlclient` is usually the top choice from among `mysqlclient`, `pymysql` and Oracle's `MySQL-Connector` for connecting to a MySQL DB in Python. It is typically the most performant of the lot and is very stable. However, there can be good reasons to choose any one of these drivers over the others - it depends on your use-case.

`mysqlclient` is a [top recommendation on the SQLAlchemy MySQL driver page](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/dialects/mysql.html#module-sqlalchemy.dialects.mysql.mysqldb):

> mysqlclient supports Python 2 and Python 3 and is very stable.

> The recommended MySQL dialects are mysqlclient and PyMySQL.

### pymysql

The PyMySQL community also actively maintains another project, called [`PyMySQL`](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL), which is a pure-python implementation. This has benefits such as not having platform-specific dependencies like `mysqlclient`. So it would seem a better fit for AWS Lambda given that it doesn't need special work (as compared to `mysqlclient`). However, it generally offers poorer performance - up to 10x slower than `mysqlclient` in some cases. Though `pymysql` aims to be 100% compatible with MySQLdb, there can be undesirable edge cases, especially when combined with other popular data-science pacakges such as `Pandas` and `SQLAlchemy`. As an example, we discovered that writing the same df with `to_sql` behaved slighly differenly across `mysqlclient` and `pymysql`. So we decided to stick to `mysqlclient` for these reasons.

### mysql-connector

Oracle (owner and maintainer of `MySQL`) also provides a pure-python library for talking to MySQL called [`MySQL Connector`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/). This is the "official" driver for Python from MySQL.

Note that SQLAlchemy [doesn't recommend](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/dialects/mysql.html#module-sqlalchemy.dialects.mysql.mysqlconnector) using this driver:

> Note

> The MySQL Connector/Python DBAPI has had many issues since its release, some of which may remain unresolved, and the mysqlconnector dialect is **not tested as part of SQLAlchemyâ€™s continuous integration**. The recommended MySQL dialects are mysqlclient and PyMySQL.

### performance comparison

`mysqlclient` can run 5x-to-10x faster (on CPython) than `pymysql`, according to these discussions and tests:

- https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/PyMySQL_evaluation#Architecture_and_Performance
- http://charlesnagy.info/it/python/python-mysqldb-vs-mysql-connector-query-performance
- https://www.programmersought.com/article/4675925085/

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51152183/fastest-way-to-read-huge-mysql-table-in-python

`pymysql` could possibly be as fast as (or faster than) `mysqlclient` if used with `PyPy`, but according to [this post on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52685419/376240), `mysqlclient` is still faster, even on PyPy3.7

### summary

For most use-cases, `mysqlclient` is the preferred choice of DB connector to MySQL, but it is not straightforward to use on AWS Lambda's Python runtime.

This project attempts to solve (or at least alleviate) this problem to a large extent by providing a relatively-straightforward path to building an AWS Layer for `mysqlclient` which can then be readily consumed in AWS Lambda Python functions.

## Usage

### prerequisites

You need a `*nix` environment where you can run docker commands and bash scripts (such as WSL2 on Windows 10 Pro, which has been tested). Tested on Ubuntu 20.04

Ensure you have docker installed. You will need to pull a [`lambci` image from docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lambci/lambda). This image will be used to build a local docker image using the `Dockerfile` and install the appropriate `mysql-devel` package.

### build the layer locally

Simply clone this repo and invoke the `build.sh` shell script; it will perform all the steps required.

`build.sh` will use the `Dockerfile` to build a docker image based off the `lambci/lambda:build-python3.8` image that very-closely replicates the AWS Lambda environment. The `mysql-community-devel` RPM will be downloaded and installed in the image. This is necessary to `pip install mysqlclient` in Amazon Linux 2. After `pip install mysqlclient` in the docker image has succeeded, the correct `.so` file and the python libs are copied out from the docker container and zipped into `build_output/layer.zip`.

This `layer.zip` file is the final artifact, ready-to-upload to AWS Lambda for your new layer.

### create a new AWS layer with `layer.zip`

You should upload `layer.zip` as-is; you don't need to zip or unzip anything.

The easiest way is to use the AWS Lambda web console. Of course, there are many ways to create a new layer from a zip, including the AWS CLI. You could potentially also use the [Serverless Framework](serverless.com) for this.

For a nice blog post with screenshots on how to upload a zip file as a new layer to AWS Lambda, read the [Deploying our Layer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lambda-layers-2f80b9211318/) section.

### reference the newly-created layer in your lambda function

Add the new layer to your Lambda function's configuration.

[TODO: ADD SCREENSHOTS HERE]

### import and run!

Finally, you can simply `import MySQLdb` in your Python3 Lambda function; here's a barebones example:

```python
import MySQLdb

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'MySQLdb was successfully imported'
    }
```

If you get the success message and don't see an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'MySQLdb'` or `ImportError: No module named _mysql`, then you're all set to use `mysqlclient` on AWS Lambda.

## Troubleshooting

See the [`mysqlclient` FAQ](https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python/blob/a33e1c38363b8c71775394965ca70d576ffd3a90/doc/FAQ.rst) that covers troubleshooting for common error cases, including build errors.

## Credits and Thanks

The work in this repo is largely based off Seungyeon Kim(Acuros Kim)'s project at: https://github.com/StyleShare/aws-lambda-python3-mysql - thanks!

I have adapted that project to build an AWS Layer using a different MySQL-devel package (the one meant for MySQL 8.0.x instead of 5.5) and targeting Python 3.8 (instead of 3.7) - as of this writing.

Thanks also to Michael Hart for [LambCI](https://github.com/lambci/lambci) - without the LambCI docker images, none of these kinds of solutions would be doable this easily.
